Meshcom

MeshCom is an application that was developed as a part of an assignment for the mobile platform development subject during my undergrads
course. It solely relies on an android device’s Wi-Fi radio capabilities to provide a medium of communication between other devices. The
limitations enforced during the development process was that: It is to be assumed that the device would not have a stable cellular or
wifi connection at any point of time.
Thus the application is a chat app that uses Android’s WiFi p2p technology to establish text based communication over a mesh network. 
Note: The attached version does not have a functional chat history section of the application. This was because the functional version
is currently experiencing some bugs.

MyCarer-Stroke

MyCarer-Stroke was a group project assigned during final year university to four people to develop a stroke rehabilitation app for stroke
survivors in a hospital setting. I had worked with my other colleagues on this app where my principle role was code implementation
and database design.
This app was designed for use on a tablet device with the main emphasis being on the development of a 
highly accessible UI (All the design decisions can be made available on request). 
App includes games and activities that aid cognition, emergency services and physical rehabilitation aids.

# In-depth documentation of both the projects can be made available through pull requests.
